      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the service commitments CloudCode provides to its customers,
        including uptime guarantees, support response times, and responsibilities for both parties. This SLA applies
        to all CloudCode services unless otherwise specified in a separate agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Service Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        CloudCode aims to provide a <strong>99.9% uptime</strong> guarantee for its hosting and development solutions.
        This means services will be available for at least 99.9% of each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance
        and force majeure events.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Uptime Calculation</h3>
      <p>
        Uptime is calculated as:
      </p>
      <pre class="rounded-md bg-gray-900 p-4 text-sm text-white">
((Total minutes in a month - Downtime minutes) / Total minutes in a month) × 100%
      </pre>
      <p>
        If uptime falls below 99.9% within a calendar month, customers may be eligible for service credits as described
        in Section 5.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Support & Response Times</h2>
      <p>CloudCode provides support through the ticketing system. Response targets are listed below:</p>

      <p><strong>Support hours:</strong> 24/7</p>

      <h2>4. Maintenance & Downtime</h2>
      <p>
        CloudCode may perform scheduled maintenance to update or improve services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planned maintenance:</strong> Customers will be notified at least 48 hours in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency maintenance:</strong> Performed when urgent fixes are required; notifications are sent as soon as possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Downtime caused by scheduled maintenance is excluded from uptime calculations.</p>

      <h2>5. Service Credits</h2>
      <p>If CloudCode fails to meet the 99.9% uptime commitment, customers may request service credits according to the tiers below:</p>

      <div class="overflow-x-auto rounded-md border">
        <table class="w-full text-left">
          <thead>

              <th class="px-4 py-3">Service Credit</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr class="border-t">
              <td class="px-4 py-3">99.9% or higher</td>
              <td class="px-4 py-3">No credit</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="border-t">

            </tr>
            <tr class="border-t">
              <td class="px-4 py-3">95.0% – 98.99%</td>
              <td class="px-4 py-3">10% credit</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="border-t">
              <td class="px-4 py-3">Below 95.0%</td>
              <td class="px-4 py-3">20% credit</td>
            </tr>
