        <li>
          Free hosting services are for development purposes only. You use them at your own risk, and we do not accept complaints regarding performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          While we strive for 99.9% uptime, it is not guaranteed. For higher uptime, please consider our paid plans.

          You may not use our services for illegal or malicious activities (including DDoS/DoS attacks, malware hosting, or crypto mining). Lavalink hosting is strictly prohibited.

          Panel admins reserve the right to suspend or delete servers showing suspicious behavior. You must log in regularly to keep your account active.
        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to refuse service. Free users should not expect guaranteed support. Abusive or rude behavior towards staff or other members will result in action against your account. Law enforcement may be contacted when required.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please back up your files regularly. While we take precautions to protect data, file recovery is not guaranteed.

          Policies may change at any time without notice. Please review the Terms periodically for updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abuse or suspicious activity may trigger our automated monitoring system, which can result in immediate suspension or deletion of your server.
